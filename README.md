# Triumph-Adler-310-Teardown
    An ongoing project to document the repair and workings of a Triumph-Adler 310 Word Processor. 

## Introduction
    This model has an external connector that uses an unknown protocol to receive input from another device like a PC. Work on reverse engineering a similar or same protocol on a similar model, the IBM 6175, was done by Majenko and Balj at the repo [here.](https://github.com/MajenkoProjects/IBM6715PrinterInterface) The IBM 6175 was based on the TA Gabrielle 9009 which is the predecessor to the TA 310. This model of typewriter was sold in multiple regions under multiple names. My model, for example, is the TA Adler 310 which has an ISO layout with a large RETURN key and accented N, M and C keys as well as a 3rd layer on the number row which includes the British Pound symbol.

    Upon documenting this device, I found that most of the components and pieces were made in what was then West Germany, many of the ICs were also marked as West Germany which I will photograph and document. This typewriter came to me from my local Goodwill, a large chain of second hand/thrift stores in the USA. Considering this is a ISO model, I feel very lucky to have found this in such good condition.

    The keyboard is another interesting find as it uses linear Cherry M9 switches, a predecessor to the MX switches. The MX switches even use the same plate mount as the M9.
