# Triumph-Adler-310-Teardown
An ongoing project to document the repair and workings of a Triumph-Adler 310 Word Processor. 

## Introduction
This model has an indluded external connector that uses an unknown protocol. Work on reverse engineering the protocol on a similar model, the IBM 6175, was done by Majenko and Balj at the repo [here.](https://github.com/MajenkoProjects/IBM6715PrinterInterface)

## Goals
A working interface that can translate text only printer commands to the word processor.
